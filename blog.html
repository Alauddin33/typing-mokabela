                whereas <span class="fw-bold">SessionStorage</span> data is cleared when the page session ends. The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB. It's session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is closed.

              <p class="card-text"><span class="fw-bold">Global Scope-</span>
                The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable. 
                Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.
                Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.
                They all have Global Scope:
                <br>
                <span class="fw-bold">Block scope</span> is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}. Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope.
                ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.
                These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.
                Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:
